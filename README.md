## Augmented Memory Networks in PyTorch

This is a work-in-progress hoby attempt to build some augmented memory networks using pytorch.

Training these networks has proven to be a lot harder than simply setting up the mathematics in pytorch as per the original papers. I've put together most of the necessary functions and structures as described in the original Neural Turing Machine paper (see docs/implementation.pdf for references).

I'm hoping to keep chipping away at this and eventually get some results from test data sets, as the bulk of the work is complete.
